------- Steps to launch EC2 via terraform -------
After configuring the AWS CLI
1. Create a new Directory for the terraform code. 
2. cd into that directory that was created. 
3. Start coding the main.tf 
4. Specify the provider for terraform (aws) in the terraform block
5. Specify the profile name and the region in the provider block
6. Specify the resource block to define components of the resource.
7. I have used the security group and the key pair that was created initially for this task itself, I've specified it in the resource block of the code. 



Please find the new screenshots that have been uploaded for this, the security groups are the same as before, those screenshots are already present.
