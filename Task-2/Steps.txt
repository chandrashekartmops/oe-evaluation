Steps to create EC2 instance with terraform 
1. Configure the AWS CLI 
2. Create a directory and cd into that directory
3. Terraform Block contains providers and is found in providers.tf; we currently have aws and terraform defined for our usecase 
4. Resources block define components of your infrastructure and is found in the main.tf
5. The variables are defined with the help of terraform.tfvars and variables.tf; this allows us to make changes to our configuration efficiently.
6. The state lock files are handled locally for now, they could be stored in a backend like S3.
7. The security group and the key pair are being reused, please find the screenshots in the screenshots folder; it has the necessary details of the securtiy group.
8. Following all this, we run "terraform init" to initialize the directory
9. We then run "terraform plan" to plan the changes
10. We validate our plan with "terraform validate" 
11. Finally we apply our changes with "terraform apply"
